Every data type has its own distinct set of methods that can be accessed using dot notation.

  Example:
    - movie_title = 'Yes man'
      - print(movie_title.upper())
        - Output: YES MAN
      - print(movie_title.lower())
        - Output: yes man

Some methods also take in arguments. For example, there's the count method.

  Example:
    - movie_title = 'Yes man' 
      - print(movie_title.count('a'))
        - Output: 1
